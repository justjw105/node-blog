# node-blog
A basic blog built with node and express

to get running:
1. install nodejs and npm
2. run npm install
3. install mongodb: for ubuntu, I ran: "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt get install mongodb"
4. if in development: install nodemon: "sudo npm install -g nodemon"

Finally, now you should be able to run the app by running: "nodemon index.js"
